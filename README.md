## steps
1) download the dataset from this link https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ek5zwv/p_64000_pictures_of_cars_labeled_by_make_model/?onetap_auto=true
2) run the code "organizing_data" in order to organize the data into different classes
3) run "training" to train the model
4) run "test on one task" to test on one car type (the 16 subclasses of nissan for example)
